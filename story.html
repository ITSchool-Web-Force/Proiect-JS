        Lilith has returned to Sanctuary, summoned by a dark ritual after eons in exile. Her return ushers in an age of
        darkness and misery.

            LEGENDS OF CREATION
            <p>An old legend has it that Sanctuary was created by the union of an angel and a demon, and that their
            descendants—humanity—built villages, then cities and empires, spreading across the land to form the world's
            cultures and civilization.</p>

            A REIGN OF ENMITY
            <p>Chaos threatens to consume Sanctuary as evil and impiety continue to spread. Depraved demons and corrupted
            wildlife roam the land unchecked, as terrified townsfolk huddle in dark corners trying to survive one more day.</p>

            CULT OF PERSONALITY
            <p>The pious plead for guidance from their faith, but doubts have them feeling that their devotion is misplaced.
            Lilith's return has spawned a new wave of cultists and worshippers, but regardless of dogma, all prayers remain
            unanswered.</p>

            DAUGHTER OF HATRED
            <p>The daughter of Mephisto awakens burning urges in the hearts of those around her, be it demon, human or beast.
            Profound fears, unchecked rage, repressed impulses, sinful desires—all are brought forth violently and
            irresistibly by her mere presence.</p>
